TwoDeviceSignalling
===================

Semester Project for Android Class

The BluetoothChat project is one created by Android as a sample project. It took me a while to get it working properly,
so if you can just clone this repository and have it work, then that's great. Please note that emulators cannot use 
bluetooth, so you have to have two android enabled devices. 

The TwoDeviceSignalling project is an empty shell that we can potentially build into. We may just modify the BluetoothChat
project as is, but I wanted to have the option.

We will have to talk with the professor about the extent to which using this code is acceptable, but I assume that since it
open source and supplied by google, we should be fine so long as we cite it.
