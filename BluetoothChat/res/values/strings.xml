    <string name="initial_info">This application is designed to help users test their knowledge of the flag semaphore system.\n\nIn order to use this application, the following requirements must be met:\n\n1) You must possess two Android devices of software version 3.0 (Honeycomb) or greater.\n\n2) Both devices must possess Bluetooth capabilities.\n\n3) Both devices must possess an accelerometer.\n\nFor any additional concerns or questions, please see the options menu. There you will find help topics on both how to use the device and the flag semaphore system.</string>
    <string name="how_to_use_info">To Use:\n\n1) Please ensure that this application is installed on two separate android devices.\n\n2) When installed, pair both devices using this application.\n\n3) To record a semaphore, press and hold the “Begin Recording” button on the device in your right hand.\n\n4) Move the devices to the desired flag positions. Ensure you maintain an even speed and keep the devices as close to parallel with each other as possible.\n\n5) Right before you stop moving, let go of the button.\n\n6) The semaphore that was made will be displayed on the screen.\n\nFor more help, see the action bar.</string>
    <string name="detection_help_title">Detection of Semaphore Help</string>
    <string name="detection_help_info">If the app does not seem to be detecting your semaphores correctly, please ensure the following are true:\n\n1) You are moving at an even speed and keeping the devices as close to parallel with each other as possible.\n\n2) The devices are linked to each other via Bluetooth.\n\n3) You are pressing the record button on the phone in your RIGHT hand.\n\n4) You are releasing the button BEFORE you stop moving. Due to the way accelerometers work, if you release at button as you stop, it counts as you moving in the OPPOSITE direction and messes up the app\'s calculations.</string>
    <string name="what_is_a_flag_semaphore_title">What is a Flag Semaphore?</string>
    <string name="what_is_a_flag_semaphore_info">The flag semaphore system is a system in which information is conveyed at a distinance through the use of visual signals.\n\nThese signals are obtained through the use of hand-held flags, rods, or even gloved hands.\n\nThe information being conveyed is determined by the positions of the objects being held.</string>
